            expenses are also much cheaper. The weather is mild to warm all year
            round. There's a huge social scene of int'l people. And it's
            geographically central: only an 11-hour flight to Bangkok and a
            6-hour flight to New York. This makes it a great place for remote
            workers and nomads to set up their base from.
